<h1>James Jimmy Barnes</h1>
<h2>Home Page</h2>

            <p> <span style="color:#cc2a1f">B</span>arnes was born April, 28 1956 in Glasgow, Scotland. His original name was 'James Dixon Swan' and his father was a featherweight boxing champion in Glasgow.
In 1961/62 his family moved to Australia. After playing in a school band
 (he replaced Bon Scott (who joined AC/DC) as lead vocalist in the band Fraternity.
Then, aged 16 and a half, he joined Cold Chisel in 1973. First they played the pubs of Adelaide, then they played the pubs of Australia and finally they got a record contract in 1976.
Now, Cold Chisel are Australian history - one of the best bands Australia ever had. They split up in 1983 because they thought
they weren't playing good music anymore and they didn't want to rip their fans off with another album.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#cc2a1f">J</span>immy started his solo career and his first album'Bodyswerve', produced by Mark Opitz, was published in 1984. It included the hit singles 'No Second Price'and 'Daylight' 
and went straight to number one in the Australian album chart.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#cc2a1f">J</span>immy left his wild years behind when he left Chisel and married Jane Mahoney (he says she saved his life). He became a responsible family man and in his life 
there was no place for rockstar nonsense. He recorded two songs ('Good Times', 'Laying Down The Law') together with INXS for the'Lost Boys' soundtrack 
and in 1988 his first live album 'Barnestorming' was published (and it sold several times platinum down under)</p>

     <p><span style="color:#cc2a1f">B</span>arnes is an Australian folk hero, he is the 'working class man'.He lived in France for a while but returned to Australia. A "best of" including a bonus
album full of rare stuff was released in October 1996 and in December 1998, Jimmy toured with some good old "friends" of the Chisel days.</p>
