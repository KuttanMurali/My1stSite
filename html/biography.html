<h1>Barnesy</h1>
<h2>Biography Page</h2>
<p>
<span style="color:#cc2a1f">J</span>immy Barnes is the heart and the soul of Australian rock & roll. His nickname, “Barnesy”, conjures up thoughts of rock music at an ear-splitting volume, 
and of soul standards given a unique reading. Jimmy has been through it all, and literally lived to tell the tales. He has sold more records in Australia 
than any other local rock & roll artist. He has enjoyed seventeen #1 albums here – more than The Beatles – and for over 40 years he has delivered some of
our most intense and iconic live performances. He is truly in a league of his own.

the ten brand new recordings on Flesh And Blood feature multiple contributions from Jimmy’s extended family including
his son Jackie on drums, his daughters Mahalia, Eliza-Jane and Elly-May all contributing vocals, as does Jackie and granddaughter,
